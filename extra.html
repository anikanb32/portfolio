        <b>Approaching difficult, deeply technical problems</b>
        <p>I thrive at the edge of design and engineering. With a foundation in computational neuroscience where I explored <b>data science</b> and <b>machine learning</b>, I always bring a systems-thinking lens to technical problem spaces.</p>
        <b>Understanding the motivations behind decisions</b>
        <p>With roots in <b>neuroscience</b> and HCI, I approach design by first understanding why people do what they do. Through mixed-method research, usability testing, and behavioral insight work across VR and program management tools, I've learned to design products that resonate.</p>
        <b>Creating a roadmap and laying tracks for problem solving</b>
        <p>I bring <b>structure</b> to ambiguity. I love translating big-picture goals into digestible steps, having directed <b>research</b> projects across immunology, neuroscience and HCI labs.</p>
